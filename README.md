A centralized, evolving repository of Python exercises and logic challenges designed to document my progression from absolute beginner to proficient programmer.

**The Problem:** Learning programming syntax is relatively easy, but developing algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills requires structured, repetitive practice. Without a centralized place to store and review past exercises, it is easy to forget core concepts or fail to see how your coding logic has improved over time.

**The Solution:** A living "sandbox" repository that meticulously tracks my learning journey through structured courses. By compiling and heavily commenting every script, this repository acts as a personal reference manual for solving foundational software engineering problems.

## 📸 Capabilities
* **Progressive Difficulty:** Structured chronologically and logically, following the curriculum of major introductory courses (like *Curso em Vídeo* Mundos 1 & 2).
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every piece of code is thoroughly commented (primarily in Portuguese) to explain the *why* behind the logic, not just the *what*.
* **Multi-Course Integration:** Combines methodologies and exercises from different teaching sources, including Guanabara's logic building and the University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody" (Py4E).
* **Core Concepts Covered:**
  * Primitive Data Types & String Manipulation
  * Arithmetic & Logical Operators
  * Control Flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
  * Iteration & Loops (`while`, `for`)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | Python 3.x | Main language for all scripts |
| **Libraries** | Standard Library | Utilizing built-in modules (`math`, `random`, etc.) |
| **Environment** | CLI / IDE | Executed via standard terminal or VS Code |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/cunhanina/Python-Chaos.git](https://github.com/cunhanina/Python-Chaos.git)
cd Python-Chaos

# 2. Navigate to a specific module (e.g., Mundo 1)
cd "Mundo 1"

# 3. Run a specific exercise
python exercise_name.py
```

## 🧠 Educational Architecture
The repository is organized to mirror a progressive learning curve:
1.  **Mundo 1 (The Basics):** Focuses on basic I/O, variable assignments, standard mathematical operations, and introductory string formatting. 
2.  **Mundo 2 (Control Flow):** Introduces conditional branching and iterative loops, transitioning from static scripts to dynamic programs that respond to user input and state changes.
